### 📊 Job Market Data Engineering Pipeline (PostgreSQL + Python)

####📌 Overview

This project is a data engineering pipeline that automates the execution of analytical SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database using Python.

####The pipeline is designed to:

- Connect to a relational database

- Execute multiple SQL files programmatically

- Orchestrate queries in a reproducible way

- Export results into structured formats for downstream analysis

This project focuses on engineering, orchestration, and automation, rather than pure analysis.

#### 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a reusable Python–PostgreSQL integration

- Automate execution of multiple SQL analysis queries

- Separate configuration, connection logic, and execution logic

- Demonstrate real-world data engineering best practices

- Produce clean, reproducible outputs from raw database tables
